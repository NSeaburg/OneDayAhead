If he had defied the Supreme Court, we'd have faced a genuine constitutional crisis. \\n\\nThe Court has no army or police force to enforce its rulings. Nixon could have gambled that no one would physically force him to surrender the tapes. But that would have shattered our constitutional norms, and Congress likely would have impeached him immediately for contempt.\\n\\nAnd yes, Nixon knew what was on those tapes - which makes his legal fight all the more desperate.
