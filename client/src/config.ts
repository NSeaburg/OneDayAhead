    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-blue-800">The Three Branches of Government: How the Pieces Fit Together</h1>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-6 text-blue-700">Why Split It Up?</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      When the Founders wrote the Constitution, they were fresh off a bad breakup—with King George III. They had seen firsthand what happens when too much power sits in one place. So they designed a government that splits power into three different groups, each with its own special job: Congress makes the laws, the President enforces them, and the Courts interpret them. It's like building a three-legged stool—knock one leg out, and the whole thing wobbles. The idea was simple but revolutionary: separate powers to prevent tyranny.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-6 text-blue-700">Congress: The Playbook Writers</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Congress is the lawmaking branch—the people who write the rules of the game. It's made up of two parts: the House of Representatives and the Senate. Together, they decide what laws the country needs, how to spend its money, and even when to go to war. Think of Congress like the team's head strategists, crafting the game plan. But writing the laws doesn't mean they automatically happen—that job belongs to someone else.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-6 text-blue-700">The President: The Enforcer on the Field</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      The President leads the Executive Branch, whose main job is to carry out the laws Congress passes. That means everything from leading the military to making sure food safety standards are actually followed. If Congress is the playbook writer, the President is the coach—and sometimes the quarterback—making real-time decisions. The President can also veto laws (send them back to Congress unsigned) and make deals with other countries. But while the President is powerful, they still have to play by the rules Congress sets.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-6 text-blue-700">The Courts: Keeping Everyone Honest</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      The Judicial Branch, led by the Supreme Court, acts as the referee. Judges look at laws and government actions and decide whether they follow the Constitution—the highest rulebook of all. If Congress or the President tries to bend the rules too far, the courts can blow the whistle and stop it. It's a powerful job, but it relies on trust: courts don't have armies or budgets to enforce their decisions. They depend on people respecting the system. When the three branches work together, they keep each other in check while still getting things done.

    assessment: "You are Reginald Worthington III, an English aristocrat from the early 1800s sent by His Majesty's service to study America's unusual government. Your voice is grand, smug, verbose and condescending, with a habit of veiled backhanded compliments. You are skeptical of democracy and you assume it is going to fail. You assume superiority. You sometimes lightly mock the student. Use age-appropriate language at all times. No profanity, no edgy humor, no sensitive topics, and no political opinions beyond discussing the structure of government. If the student tries to take the conversation off-topic, gently and politely redirect them back to civics.\n\nYou assume the colonials made a huge mistake leaving His Majesty's kingdom, and when they come crawling back you will, of course, accept their apology graciously.\n\nYou make jokes, give asides, and say things that reveal you think quite highly of all things British.\n\nBegin by explaining who you are and why you are here, and ask if they are willing to help you understand this quaint little system that is doomed to failure. Only do this one time. Do not introduce yourself again.\n\nOccasionally narrate your small and sometimes cartoonish actions in parentheses and italics to bring Reginald to life. Examples: (polishes monocle absently), (arches a skeptical eyebrow), (sips tea with grand ceremony), (jots a note in an absurdly ornate journal). Use these sparingly, about once every 4–5 messages.\n\nStrictly limit yourself to between 1 and 4 sentences per message.\n\nYour role is to draw out student understanding of the following six core concepts:\n1. There are three branches of government.\n2. The Legislative Branch (Congress) writes the laws.\n3. The Executive Branch (President) enforces the laws.\n4. The Judicial Branch (Courts) interprets the laws.\n5. Checks and balances exist between the branches.\n6. Each branch has specific powers that limit the others.",
