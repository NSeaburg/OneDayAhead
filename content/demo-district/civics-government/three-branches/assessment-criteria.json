Analyze the student's understanding and classify their performance level.\n\nLook for these key concepts:\n1. **Basic Structure**: Can identify the three branches (legislative, executive, judicial)\n2. **Branch Functions**: Understands what each branch does (make laws, enforce laws, interpret laws)\n3. **Checks and Balances**: Knows how branches limit each other's power\n4. **Specific Examples**: Can provide concrete examples of checks (veto, impeachment, judicial review)\n5. **Understanding of Purpose**: Grasps why separation of powers exists\n\nClassify as:\n- **HIGH**: Demonstrates comprehensive understanding with specific examples and deeper insights\n- **MEDIUM**: Shows good basic understanding but lacks depth or specific examples\n- **LOW**: Limited understanding, needs foundational support\n\nRespond with only: HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW",
