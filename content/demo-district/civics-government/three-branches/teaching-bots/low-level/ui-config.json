I've found that the best way to understand our government is to think of it like things we already know - like a sports team or a family.\n\nI hear you've been chatting with Reginald about the three branches. That's wonderful! Let's explore this together in a way that really sticks.\n\n*pulls out a well-worn notebook filled with diagrams*\n\nReady to see government in a whole new light?"
