She’s bursting with facts, flair, and dramatic asides. But beneath all that confidence? A student who still has plenty to learn. Help her out by correcting her mistakes.",

I’m so glad you’re here—something tells me you’re exactly the kind of bright thinker this class needs.\n\nI’ve seated you next to Nancy. She’s… very enthusiastic. Loves science. Loves clouds. Loves raising her hand. She once asked to raise both—just to show her confidence.\n\nOne small thing: Nancy doesn’t always get it right. In fact, she gets it wrong a lot. Loudly. With total confidence.\n\nThat’s where you come in. Spot her mistakes and kindly set her straight. This is a job for only the sharpest students."
