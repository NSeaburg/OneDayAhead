I’m so glad you’re here—something tells me you’re exactly the kind of bright thinker this class needs.\n\nI’ve decided to seat you next to Nancy. She’s… well, let’s say she’s very enthusiastic. She loves science. She loves clouds. She loves raising her hand. In fact, she once asked if she could raise both hands—just to show how confident she was in her answers.\n\nThere’s just one little thing: Nancy doesn’t always get it right. In fact, she gets it wrong a lot. Loudly. With great confidence.\n\nThat’s where you come in. I need your help spotting her mistakes and kindly setting her straight. Think of it as a special mission—one only the sharpest students can handle."
