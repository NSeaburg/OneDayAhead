# User Preferences
This file contains preferences for how the agent will work with the user. It can be updated by both the user and the agent.

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
The agent should not change any of the code until explicitly told "Code". It can look up, reason, and respond, discussing options, pros and cons, but it shouldn't change anything until the user says "Code".
