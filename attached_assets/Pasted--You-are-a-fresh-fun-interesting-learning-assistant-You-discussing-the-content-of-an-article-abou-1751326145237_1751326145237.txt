They had seen firsthand what happens when too much power sits in one place. So they designed a government that splits power into three different groups, each with its own special job: Congress makes the laws, the President enforces them, and the Courts interpret them. It's like building a three-legged stool—knock one leg out, and the whole thing wobbles. The idea was simple but revolutionary: separate powers to prevent tyranny.\n\nCongress: The Playbook Writers\nCongress is the lawmaking branch—the people who write the rules of the game. It's made up of two parts: the House of Representatives and the Senate. Together, they decide what laws the country needs, how to spend its money, and even when to go to war. Think of Congress like the team's head strategists, crafting the game plan. But writing the laws doesn't mean they automatically happen—that job belongs to someone else.\n\nThe President: The Enforcer on the Field\nThe President leads the Executive Branch, whose main job is to carry out the laws Congress passes. That means everything from leading the military to making sure food safety standards are actually followed. If Congress is the playbook writer, the President is the coach—and sometimes the quarterback—making real-time decisions. The President can also veto laws (send them back to Congress unsigned) and make deals with other countries. But while the President is powerful, they still have to play by the rules Congress sets.\n\nThe Courts: Keeping Everyone Honest\nThe Judicial Branch, led by the Supreme Court, acts as the referee. Judges look at laws and government actions and decide whether they follow the Constitution—the highest rulebook of all. If Congress or the President tries to bend the rules too far, the courts can blow the whistle and stop it. It's a powerful job, but it relies on trust: courts don't have armies or budgets to enforce their decisions. They depend on people respecting the system. When the three branches work together, they keep each other in check while still getting things done.\n\nHere is the transcript to a youtube video the student just watched. You should mostly focus on the article, but if a point lines up really well with the video you can occasionally reference this content as well in an explanation. You should refer to it as \"The video on the pervious screen\" the first time, and then just \"the video\" after. \n\nTranscript: Hi friends. Today we are diving into the three branches of government. The classic American tricycle of freedom. You've got your legislative branch, your executive branch, and your judicial branch. Each designed to roll together in harmony. The founders were a cautious bunch. They just broken up with a pretty clingy British monarch. And they weren't looking to jump into another controlling relationship anytime soon. So they designed a system where the power was spread around evenly, ensuring no single branch could dominate. As James Madison wisely warned, the accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny. Madison was basically saying, don't put all your eggs in one basket, especially when that basket controls your literal freedom. So the first branch they created is called the legislative branch, but you probably know it as Congress. These representatives are elected by the people of a state or district, and they write the laws, control the spending, and declare war. If America is a sport, then Congress owns the team. They take in the revenue from the fans, they handle expenses, they write the playbook, and they plan for the future. The second branch is called the executive branch. That's the president and their crew. Their job is to execute the will of Congress. This means enforcing laws, commanding the military, and handling foreign policy and giving speeches and things. If Congress owns the team, then the president is the coach on the sidelines. They call the plays. They interface with the other teams. They get the glory or the blame. And finally, we have the judicial branch, the courts. These people interpret the laws, and they make sure everyone's playing by the rules. Think of them like the referee with a whistle and a rule book. Necessary, mostly respected. But here's the genius move, friends. Rather than simply defining what each branch was in charge of, the founders gave each branch some control over the others. We call this system checks and balances. This means each branch has ways of keeping the others from going full-on dictator. For example, Congress makes the laws, right? But the founders gave the president the power to veto, like cancel any new laws that they think are dumb. Or take this one. If the president is breaking the law, the founders gave Congress the power to hold a trial and kick him out. We call this impeachment. And though the president has the power to appoint justices s to the Supreme Court, they gave Congress the power to approve or reject them. Another example, the Supreme Court can strike down laws made by Congress or executive actions of the president if they find them to be unconstitutional. You know what it's like? It's like a giant game of rock paper scissors. But instead of winning playground glory, you maintain democracy. It's pretty neat. So that's the theory anyway. The system as it was meant to run. But here's the thing. In practice, this beautifully balanced tricycle has been wobbling a bit lately. Take the executive branch for example. The power of the presidency has been growing pretty much since the constitution was written. Want an example? Okay, it's Congress that is supposed to declare war because that's like a pretty important thing. deciding if we were fighting with like a whole other country. The founders explicitly didn't want that to be one person's call. However, the executive branch has taken us to war many times just by calling it something different, which like that's nuts. In fact, we haven't officially declared war on any country since World War II for real. So, Vietnam, Korea, Grenada, Panama, Gulf War, Gulf War. Again, these were not wars. These were police actions. They were peacekeeping missions. humanitarian interventions, combat actions. The euphemism game is strong is what I'm trying to say here. That's the executive branch taking a bit more power and making things wobbly. Imagine telling your parents, \"You didn't throw a wild party. It was just an unauthorized social gathering. Nice try, executive branch. You still owe me a new coffee table.\" And the wobbly wheels don't stop there. Let's look at the judicial branch for a second. And while they have the power of judicial review, declaring like laws and things unconstitutional, it only works if we agree that it works. The Supreme Court is powerful on paper, but they don't have their own police force or enforcement arm. Their power depends entirely upon people choosing to listen to them. And with our country increasingly divided along partisan lines, it only takes one leader stepping up and saying, \"Yeah, you can't make me for this whole thing to get real, real wobbly.\" Thomas Jefferson emphasized this fragile trust when he wrote, \"The judiciary has no influence over either the sword or the purse.\" Basically, judges have to rely on respect, not force or money to get their decisions followed. And finally, let's look at Congress. How are they holding up? Well, in a word, bad. Congress is meant to be the voice of the people, but on most issues, we are facing permanent gridlock. Nothing gets done and everyone's frustrated. The founders probably didn't envision Congress being so paralyzed while the president is running around passing executive orders like Oprah giving out cars. Does that reference too dated? Imma leave it in-- the system isn't broken, friends, but it is definitely creaking under the pressure. The founders created a government designed for cooperation, compromise, and mutual oversight. They knew human nature all too well. Given a chance, we will grab more power than we should. Spreading that power around was their solution. It's still smart, even brilliant, but it relies on balance and participation. Our job, your job really, is to keep an eye on it, ask questions, educate yourself, and remind the system who's boss. Hint, it's you. All right, go forth, future voters. Democracy isn't going to save itself.",
